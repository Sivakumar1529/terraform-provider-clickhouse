## Introduction

ClickHouse is a fast open-source columnar database management system that is designed for real-time analytics. With the Terraform provider for ClickHouse Cloud, you can easily manage your ClickHouse resources through code. This enables you to maintain consistency and version control over your infrastructure.

## Getting Started

To get started with the Terraform provider for ClickHouse, you will need to have Terraform installed on your machine. You can download Terraform from the [official website](https://www.terraform.io/downloads.html).

### Prerequisites

- Terraform 0.12 or later
- ClickHouse Cloud account

## Installation

You can download the latest release of the Terraform provider from the [Releases section](https://github.com/Sivakumar1529/terraform-provider-clickhouse/releases). After downloading, follow these steps:

1. Extract the downloaded file.
2. Move the provider binary to your Terraform plugins directory, usually located at `~/.terraform.d/plugins/`.
3. Ensure the binary has execute permissions.

## Usage

Here‚Äôs a simple example of how to use the Terraform provider for ClickHouse:

```hcl
provider "clickhouse" {
  endpoint = "https://your-clickhouse-cloud-endpoint"
  user     = "your-username"
  password = "your-password"
}

resource "clickhouse_database" "example" {
  name = "example_db"
}

resource "clickhouse_table" "example" {
  database = clickhouse_database.example.name
  name     = "example_table"
  
  column {
    name = "id"
    type = "UInt32"
  }
  
  column {
    name = "name"
    type = "String"
